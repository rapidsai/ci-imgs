# Contributing to ci-imgs

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report a bug or request a feature
The best way to get in touch is by [opening an issue](https://github.com/rapidsai/ci-imgs/issues/new/choose).

## To make a code contribution
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Developer Certificate of Origin
All contributions to this project must be accompanied by a sign-off indicating that the contribution is made pursuant to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

The DCO is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution. To certify your adherence to the DCO, you must sign off on your commits. This is done by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

You can do this automatically with `git commit -s`.

Here is the full text of the DCO, which you can also find at <https://developercertificate.org/>:

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
